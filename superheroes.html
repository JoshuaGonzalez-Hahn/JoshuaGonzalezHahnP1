        <h2>Brief History About Marvel Superheroes</h2>
        <p>
          The precursor to Marvel Comics was founded in 1939 by pulp magazine
          publisher Martin Goodman. In order to capitalize on the growing
          popularity of comic books—especially those starring
          superheroes—Goodman created Timely Comics. Timely's first comic book
          was Marvel Comics no. 1 (cover dated October 1939), which featured
          several superhero characters, most notably the Human Torch and the
          Sub-Mariner. Timely Comics introduced many superhero characters during
          comics' “Golden Age” in the 1940s, most importantly Captain America,
          who first appeared in Captain America Comics no. 1 (March 1941).

          I have been into superheroes ever since I was a kid. Whether that be
          from playing with action figures or pretending to be a superhero. I've
          watched countless shows, movies, and cartoons. I've also played
          superhero video games. Many heroes have caught my attention and were
          my favorite at one point in time. There are a few superheros that I
          would consider my favorite, but if I had to choose one, it would be
          Spider-Man! To me, he is amazing (no pun intended)! He has the
          characteristics of being funny, intelligent, grounded, and strong. He
          has really cool abilities and is fun to watch or play Spider-Man
          games.

          <summary>
            Who is it? <br />
            An unyielding hero whose character is his greatest strength, marked
            by unwavering integrity, honesty, loyalty, and a strong moral
            compass. Though physically powerful, his core identity comes from
            his purity of spirit and selfless desire to do what is right.(Click
