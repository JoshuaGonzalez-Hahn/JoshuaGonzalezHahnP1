        <h2>Brief History Of Video Games</h2>
        <p>
          The history of video games began in the 1950s and 60s with mainframe
          computer experiments like Spacewar! and Tennis for Two, leading to the
          first home console, the Magnavox Odyssey, and the first arcade hit,
          Pong, in the early 1970s. The industry experienced a "Golden Age" of
          arcade success in the late 70s and early 80s, followed by a crash in
          1983. The market revived in 1985 with the Nintendo Entertainment
          System, ushering in the modern era of consoles, handhelds, and PC
          gaming, evolving into the massive industry it is today. <br />

        <h2>My Favorite Video Game</h2>
        <p>
          I have been playing video games for as long as I can remember. Playing
          video games is one of my favorite activities to do. I like playing
          action games majority of the time and that spans across different
          genres of games. What I love about video games is that I can choose
          between single player or multiplayer games. The fun in gaming comes
          from playing with my friends and family. With the most fun and
          enjoyable time comes from playing video games with my girlfriend!
          <br />

          As mentioned before, over my lifetime I have played many games. Some
          have made me go through every emotion possible, while other have made
          me question why did I even buy this game. Many games hold a special
          place in my heart and deserve to be my favorite game. However, putting
          nostalgia to side, my favorite game would have to be Marvel's Spider
          Man!

          Now a days there are many places to play games. You can play on a
          mobile device, console, or PC. Ever since a kid, my family managed
          from time to time to get the new gaming devices that were out at the
          time. We have had PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo Game Boy, Nintendo DS,
          and the PSP. One has stuck with me over the years and holds a special
          place in my heart. As you may have guessed by my favorite game, where
          I choose to play is on PlayStation!
