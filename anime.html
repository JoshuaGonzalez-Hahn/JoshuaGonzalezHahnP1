<!-- This page uses the <tbody> HTML element. It encapsulates a set of table rows (<tr> elements), indicating 
     that they comprise the body of a table's main data. I'm using it to have a table hold the animes that I have watched 
     along with the year they came out. <tbody> is found at the first instance of <table>.-->

<!-- Along with tbody im using the scope attribute. Scope helps screen readers understand the relationship 
     between headers and data. It improves accessibility (ARIA). Im using it to help screen readers understand the 
     relationships of the table. Screen readers will now announce “Row: Naruto, Year Released: 2002” instead of just reading 
     cells out of context. Scope is found at the <table> section.  -->

<!-- This page also uses the <summary> element. The <summary> element specifies a summary, caption, or legend for a 
     <details> element's disclosure box. I'm using it as a way to engage the user. It's reveals my favorite character, 
     but let's the user have a guess first by reading the description. The use of <summary> can be found after the 
     h2 tag "Who Is My Favorite Character?".  -->

            Anime began with short films in the early 20th century, with the
            first widely accepted "real" anime being The Dull Sword (1917) by
            Junichi Kochi. The industry grew through the use of cel animation
            and the founding of studios like the Kitayama Movie Factory in the
            1920s. Osamu Tezuka's work in the 1960s helped establish a
            distinctive anime style, leading to its spread and evolution into
            the global phenomenon it is today, with major studio Toei Animation
            and later Studio Ghibli shaping its modern form. <br />

        <h2>My Favorite Anime</h2>
        <p>
          Overtime I have watched alot of different animes! Some were great,
          fun, engaging, while others weren't so much. At first, when I was in
          highschool I wasn't that big of a fan of anime. Although, as a kid I
          had been unknowingly watching anime. Some of the animes I watched as a
          kid were Pokemon, Yu-Gi-Oh, and Astro Boy. It wasnt until early
          college days that I started giving anime a chance. <br />
          <br />
          <img
            src="images/naruto.jpg"
            alt="naruto"
            width="340"
            height="280"
            class="flowRight"
          />
          As mentioned before, I have watched plenty of anime overtime, but
          there is one anime that holds a special place in my heart. And that
          anime is Naruto! It was one of the first animes that I watched and I
          was completely invested. Naruto has so many memorable moments and
          characters. The moment I started watching I wanted to know what the
          next episode had instore. Aside from the countless filler episodes,
          Naruto is full of humor and action. Despite it's moments of silliness
          there are plenty of heart breaking and jaw dropping scenes. Naruto
          captures emotion and entertainment all in one package. These are some
          of the reasons why naruto is my favorite anime of all time!

            Described as a laid-back, intelligent, and powerful Jonin who is a
            tactical genius known for his relaxed demeanor and sarcastic wit,
            but who becomes a stern and calm leader in crucial moments.
